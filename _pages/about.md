I am a Research Technician III at the [University of Arizona, College of Internal Medicine](https://phoenixmed.arizona.edu/medicine) working under [Dr. Fredric Wondisford](https://provost.arizona.edu/person/fredric-wondisford).  Prior to joining University of Arizona, I was an MS student at Purdue University, Fort Wayne (PFW) working with [Prof. Ahmed Mustafa](https://users.pfw.edu/mustafaa) within Life Science Resource Center. During my MS at PFW, I also served as a teaching assistant for various Biology-related graduate and under-graduate courses. Also, I completed MS and Bachelors from  [Tribhuvan University](https://tu.edu.np/), Nepal. I am honored with various awards including PFW Top 50 Award, and nominee for Best TA Award. 

#### **Research Overview**
I am interested in three main research areas: (a) Understanding post-translational modifications in thyroid hormone receptors within hypothalamic neurons and their implications for metabolic diseases such as diabetes and obesity, (b) Exploring the molecular mechanisms involved in the onset of cancer and investigating potential therapeutic interventions, with a focus on immunotherapy, and (c) Employing cutting-edge machine learning models across diverse domains, particularly in the fields of Cancer Biology and Molecular Biology.


#### **Research Interests**
Cancer Biology, Neuroscience, Endocrinology, Immunology, Cell and Molecular Biology, Stress Physiology.
