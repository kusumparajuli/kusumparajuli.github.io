I am a Research Associate at [Genista Biosciences](http://www.genistabio.com/) under the Molecular Biology team. Before joining Genista Biosciences, I was an MS student at Purdue University, Fort Wayne (PFW) working with [Prof. Ahmed Mustafa](https://users.pfw.edu/mustafaa) within Life Science Resource Center. Also, during my MS at PFW, I served as a teaching assistant for various Biology-related undergraduate and graduate courses. Also, I completed MS and Bachelors from  [Tribhuvan University](https://tu.edu.np/), Nepal. I am honored with various awards including PFW Top 50 Award, and Best TA Award. 

#### **Research Overview**
I am interested in two main research areas: (a) Exploring the molecular mechanisms involved in the onset of cancer and investigating potential therapeutic interventions, with a focus on immunotherapy, and (b) employing cutting-edge machine learning models across diverse domains, particularly in the fields of Cancer Biology and Molecular Biology.


#### **Research Interests**
Cell and Molecular Biology, Cancer Biology, Stress Physiology, Microbiology, Immunology, Stem Cell Biology.
